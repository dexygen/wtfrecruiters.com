              On January 8th I was contacted by a recruiter, who would in turn be placing me with a consulting company, who in turn would have me working for their client.
              It wouldn't be my first such rodeo.
            </p>
            <p class="m-1 text-lg">
              There were some initial WTF's with the recruiter as regards rate.  First I got quoted one rate on W2 but then presented with a rate $12 lower, then
              I got presented with a corp-to-corp rate, but I digress as we worked something out.
            </p>
            <p class="m-1 text-lg">
              The real WTF came from the consulting company.  All seemed to be going great at first.  I did so well on an initial video interview round that it was
              decided for the next video round the client themselves would be participating.
            </p>
            <p class="m-1 text-lg">
              Less than 25 minutes before that second round I missed a phone call from the consulting company, I was working and when I'm doing so I keep my ringer off.
              Closer to the time of the interview, 12-15 minutes before, I see that I have an email from the consulting company saying to please call.
            </p>
            <p class="m-1 text-lg">
              On that call I get told I must have "strong experience" with a previously un-mentioned technology.  Being as I only have a few months with it, and that was
              three years ago, I always pass over such job listings.
            </p>
            <p class="m-1 text-lg">
              So I hung up and proceeded to send out a bunch of nasty-grams.  In the meantime the person I spoke to on the phone emails me and makes it sound as though it's
              my fault; to quote: "We tried calling you a few times to explain the situation."
            </p>
            <p class="m-1 pb-1 text-lg border-b-2">
              First, that's a lie, he called exactly ONCE, I've got the cell phone logs to prove it.  And he's delusional if he thinks speaking to me about this about-face 
              twenty-four minutes before the interview would have made more of a difference than speaking to me ten minutes ahead of time.  I can only imagine how these
              charlatans explained me backing out to the client, indeed I wouldn't be surprised if they presented me as being the unreasonable one.
            </p>
            <p class="m-1 pb-1 text-lg border-b-2">
              <span class="font-bold">UPDATE: </span>The next morning I was contacted TWICE by the same first-level recruiting company about the same position, and both
              responded back that the technology mentioned to me as being required at the last minute, was not required.  So the charlatans at the consulting company could
              well put another person into the same predicament as me; shame on them.
            </p>
